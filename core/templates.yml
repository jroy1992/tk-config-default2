# This file is one of the central points in the Shotgun Pipeline Toolkit configuration and
# a counterpart to the folder configuration structure.
#
# The folder structure underneath the project folder is used to create folders on disk -
# templates.yml (this file) refers to those folders. Therefore, the two files need to be
# in sync. This file contains an overview of all locations that are used by Sgtk.
#
# Whenever an app or an engine refers to a location on disk, it is using an entry defined in
# this file. For more information, see the Shotgun Pipeline Toolkit Documentation.



#
# The keys section contains the definitions for all the different keys that are being
# used by Sgtk. A key is a magic token that is replaced by a value at runtime, for example
# {Shot}. The section below tells Sgtk which data types and formats to expect for each key.

#
# The paths section contains all the the key locations where files are to be stored
# by Sgtk Apps. Each path is made up of several keys (like {version} or {shot}) and
# these are defined in the keys section above.
#
# Apps use these paths as part of their configuration to define where on disk
# different files should go.
#
# In this default configuration, all of the root_name keys will be set to 'primary'.
# This is because the default configuration stores all its production data in a single
# tree and hence uses a single root folder on disk. If you wanted to extend the
# configuration to span multiple root points, for example because you want to store
# renders on a different server, you could define an additional root in Shotgun, and
# then switch any relevant templates to point to that one instead.
#
paths:

    # Common  path definitions to use as shorthand in order to avoid repetitive and verbose
    # templates. This also makes it easy to change any of the common root paths and have the
    # changes apply to all templates that use them.
    #
    # These don't require the standard formatting (with definition and root_name) because they
    # will be set within each template that uses the alias.
    # A valid path needs to contain at least one '/' character.
    #     these have been embedded into the templates...

    # Naming convention:
    #     Level-specific templates include their 'env_name' [e.g. 'project'|'sequence'|'shot']
    #     DCC-specific templates start with 'engine_name' [e.g. 'tk-nuke']
